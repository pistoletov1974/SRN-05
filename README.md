# SRN-05
This is software for STM32F4 MCU for controlling old USSR machine SRN-05 for winding coils.
MCU read encoder data and divide this frequency to drive stepper motor which produce coil programmed step.
LCD2004 is interface for setup step, cumber of coils an speed of main motor.
Encoder used in this project have 2000 pulses
